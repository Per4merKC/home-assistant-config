This is my configuration... I'm new to Home-Assistant, but have roots back
in the [Mister House](http://misterhouse.net) days. :-)

I plan on trying to recreate some of the awesome scripts from those days and
integrating them with modern technology and convienence.

## My Setup:

- Raspberry Pi 3 running Hass.io
- Vera Controller

  - X10 CM11a Interface

    - Dining Room Chandelier
    - Kitchen Lights
    - Guest Bedroom Light

  - Z-Wave

    - Fibaro Eye
    - 3 Leviton Plug-In Dimmer Modules
    - 2 Aeotec Recessed Door Sensors
    - 2 BeSense Ceiling PIR Motion Detectors
    - GE Outdoor Module

- IKEA Tr√•dfri
  - Bathroom Sink Light
  - Desk Lights
- Honeywell WiFi Thermostat
- Amazon Echo Dot
- Amazon Echo Spot
